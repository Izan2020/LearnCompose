# LearnCompose
This project served as a learning experience for me as I delved into the Jetpack Compose framework. As a developer, 
I embarked on this project to familiarize myself with the intricacies of Jetpack Compose and its capabilities. Through 
practical application, I gained hands-on experience in creating user interfaces using Jetpack Compose's powerful set of tools and widgets.

During the course of this project, I chose to replicate the UI of Gojek's Gofood and the YouTube Home screen. By undertaking these tasks, 
I honed my skills in creating complex and visually appealing user interfaces using Jetpack Compose's @Composable Kotlin functions. T
hese exercises allowed me to understand the nuances of building UI components and structuring layouts in Jetpack Compose.

In addition to mastering UI development, I also focused on learning state management techniques in Jetpack Compose. Specifically,
I delved into the usage of the ViewModel component, which helped me manage and maintain the state of my app's data. By employing ViewModel,
I was able to separate the UI logic from the data, ensuring a more organized and maintainable codebase.

Another important aspect of the project was exploring navigation and screen routing in Jetpack Compose. 
I delved into different methods and techniques for navigating between screens and managing the flow of the app.
This knowledge proved invaluable in creating seamless transitions and enabling users to navigate through various sections of the app effortlessly.

Overall, this project served as a comprehensive learning journey, enabling me to grasp the fundamentals of Jetpack Compose,
practice UI development, understand state management with ViewModel, and implement effective navigation and routing techniques.
